This s2i image is design to tag an image stream that it is watching. 
It was inspired by https://github.com/YannMoisan/openshift-tagger-custom-builder 
which uses a `type: Custom` stategy which isn't enabled by default
due to security concerns and which isn't enabled on openshift online pro.
This s2i just does the work of that custom strategy and writes unchanged
layers to the output s2i image which is ignored.
